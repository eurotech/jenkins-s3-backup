# Jenkins Backup Script

## Jenkins Folders

- jobs
  - copy recursively the config.xml, nextBuildNumber and jobs subfolder
  - nextBuildNumber is not present if the node if a Folder
  - the jobs folder is not present if the node is not a Folder
- secrets
  - save all except the master.key (this should be seeded differently)
- users
- nodes
- plugins
- configs
  - all the XML stored at top level are prbably configs ... save them

If we are not interest in a particular category it should be possible to exclude it.

## Compression

We will use parallel `xz` compression.

## S3 Storage

We just just `aws s3 mv` the file to S3.
